This is a modifed version of the mtsblend plugin for blender 
(https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/tracker/projects/mtsblend).
This plugin allows mitsuba to be used as a renderer in blender and also
exposes mitsuba materials to the blender user interface.

This modifed versions adds an entry and registers simple controls for the
woven cloth material that is implemented in mitsubadir/src/bsdfs.
